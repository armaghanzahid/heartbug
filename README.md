## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if any source files are changed.

## Description

This project is a simple To-Do list application that enables users to manage their tasks, including adding new tasks, editing existing ones, marking them as completed or pending, and deleting tasks.
Tasks are persistently stored using **Firebase Firestore**. 

For demo purposes, I did not exclude environment variables for Firestore repository (not ignored in `.gitignore`).

## Deployment
The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed live at:
[HB-TodoApp on Vercel](https://heartbug-git-main-armaghanzahids-projects.vercel.app/home)

## Features

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new task with a description.
- Edit the description of an existing task.
- Mark a task as "Completed" or "Pending."
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Data is stored persistently in Firebase Firestore.

## Requirements

### User Interface:
- The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- The application should allow users to:
  - View a list of tasks.
  - Add new tasks.
  - Edit tasks.
  - Mark tasks as "Completed" or "Pending."
  - Delete tasks.

### Functionality:
- Each task should have:
  - A description.
  - A status (either "Pending" or "Completed").
- Users should be able to change the task's status between "Completed" and "Pending."

### Storage:
- Tasks are stored persistently in **Firebase Firestore**.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Tools**: Angular CLI, Firebase SDK

## Use Case

1. A user opens the web app and sees a list of tasks.
2. The user can add a new task by entering a description and clicking the "Add Task" button.
3. The user can click on a task to edit the description or mark it as "Completed."
4. The user can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
5. The task list updates automatically after any action (add, edit, delete).

## Goals

- Clean and well-structured code.
- A simple, intuitive user interface.
- Persistent data handling using Firebase Firestore.
- Proper state management and UI updates based on user actions.
- Any additional features or creative touches are welcome but not required.
